# Skybox Editor by Glitchy #
This tool displays in a very simple interface a skybox and all the information corresponding to the single skybox and allows the user to modify them. You cannot create new skyboxes with it just edit existing ones.

## Additional Information ##
Created for 2.x (Burning Crusade) DBCs, so will not work for WotlK.
