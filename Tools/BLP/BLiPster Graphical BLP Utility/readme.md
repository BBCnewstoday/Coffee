Trying to figure out an easy way to convert Blizzard's BLP files to something more manageable but can't find the right program? Tired of trying to use command-line utilities in a graphical interface world? Look no longer!

BLiPster is a Windows-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) to convert Blizzard's BLP files to Portable Network Graphic (PNG) image files. Utilizing Dandelion's BLPConverter command-line program, this stand-alone utility focuses on giving you, the user, complete control over the conversion process. This multi-threaded application will batch convert BLPs in seconds.

The source code for this program is included in the file. Read the BLPConverterGUI.rtf file for more information (especially since one of the important dll's could not be included with the source code due to licensing restrictions). The program requires .NET 4.0 framework; if the installer does not detect the framework, it will give you the option of downloading and installing the framework from Microsoft.
