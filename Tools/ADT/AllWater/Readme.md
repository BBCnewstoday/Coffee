# AllWater by Gretchin #
This is a CMD tool to add a flat water surface to an WotLK ADT.

## Usage ##
Copy the tool to the folder where you have your ADTs in. Do not forget a backup like always. Open a command prompt, navigate to your ADT folder and type.

To find out the water level fly in noggit to the place you want water and move to the height where you want it. Then use the Z value for the water level. The type is an entry in the LiquidType.dbc

	15 - Green lava
	181 - Orange slime
