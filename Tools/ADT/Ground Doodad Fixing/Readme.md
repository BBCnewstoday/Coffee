# Ground Doodad Fixing #

This tool fixes ground doodads display on an ADT. Usage is simple: drop a single ADT onto the program, or make a bash/batch file for processing multiple files.

The program will generate a new file named the same as the input ADT but with the suffix "_new" so the original file isn't overwritten.

Most likely you will be using this tool after you use the Ground Effects tool.

This tool is deprecated as of Noggit, revision 520 (ce528f32e12a).
