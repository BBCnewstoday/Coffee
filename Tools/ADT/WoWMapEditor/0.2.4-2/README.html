<p>Well, I never though I would be releasing the source code this early, but 
here it is.<br>
This is the source code of WoWMapEditor version 0.2.4 with one or two minor 
revisions.</p>
<p><b><font size="5">Language:</font></b><br>
This project is written in Visual Basic 6.&nbsp; <b>NOT IN VB.NET<br>
</b>From what I have seen a while ago, the VB.Net wizard suck ass a converting 
old VB to .NET, so I say don bother trying.&nbsp; Just use a regular VB compiler<br>
I believe this project can be used in older VB compilers, an older compiler may 
not accep the files, but the code I beleive should work if you C&amp;P into one.<br>
<br>
You will want to open the .vbp files in a VB compiler, as that open them all 
together.</p>
