As per Mjolla: "I slightly edited the program to make it fit: one normal per triangle (so their number was divided by 3), and I added cross product + normalize to calculate the values for each of them using the existing functions."

Pretty much the same as 10-26, but features a bug fix that should fix the ~40% models that didn't recieve collision in the previous versions.
