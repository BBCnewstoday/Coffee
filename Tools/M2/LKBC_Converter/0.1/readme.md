This is a pre-release version which is extremely buggy.

The converter SHOULD be able to handle :

* Models like creatures with all animations
* All static models
* Models with multiple .skin files

The converter is NOT able to handle :

* Models with .anim files (this include character models)
* Lights
* Ribbons
* Particles
* Texture Animations


A lot of models works, but you can get funky animations sometimes (I found out this way pandaren Stags were fine dancers). Use it wisely.

I will try to add the compiled binaries for Windows & Linux as soon as possible.
