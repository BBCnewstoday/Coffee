wowmodelminer.exe [itemcache.wdb]

------------------
What does it do?
------------------

It converts the items and npcs you have seen ingame into csv files for use in the wowmodelviewer.
Remember not to overwrite your existing items.csv or npcs.csv, just copy and paste the new items/creatures that you would like
manually.

------------------
Installation
------------------

Just place it in your .\Cache\WDB\enUS\ folder and then run it.
