**Darker Nights** - Milly

Each zone has it's main light settings set to near black, while the sky and clouds settings are set to darker versions of the original colors. This helps keep the original atmosphere of each zone intact. I also applied similar lighting effects to underwater areas during the night. Though unfortunately, the one zone I didn't do in Vashj'ir simply because it is an abomination with dozens of different light sources that I didn't want to deal with.

This will work for 3.3.5a, but not for zones updated for Cataclysm as this patch is designed for 4.3.4.
