ÿ+ABC (Rotation) Help
	
	All numbers are in degrees, and they start facing south.
	So if ABC = {0,0,0 } then the object is untilted lookin south.

	Also, I THINK the pivot point is either at the botom of each object, or maybe off it
	I say this based on test where I blew up the doodad size and change a rotation...
	...amd then is dissappeared o_O.


	The following refers to if your character is south of the object and looking north to it:

	A = Tilt fowards/backwards. +90 = fall down on face
	B = Turn left/right
	C = Sideways, lie down
ÿ-XYZ Help

	NOTICE: YOU DON'T HAVE TO EDIT XY NUMBERS MANUALLY!
	It is esier to goto the map, right-click a selection, and go "move to where I click"

	X = Decrease to go west.  Increase to go east.
	Y = Decrease to go north.  Increase to go south.
	Z = Decrease to go down? Increase to go up?
ÿHThe map you have selected for editing appears to be on the black-list.
Please understand that if people were able to manipulate maps such as these Blizzard would 
nerf map editing hard.  And then NO ONE, not even nice fair-play map edits can't be done.
The purpose of this software is to let people make cities that dont normally exist and to aid in 
exploration.  Not exploit.

If you think this is an error, please note the file path in the .MPQ and say so on the website 
here: http://www.somewhiteguy.homelinux.org:178/wowedit/ 

Thanks for understanding

ÿ²Hello, this is a World of Warcraft Map Editor

While this program can be used for exploration among many other fun 
things, it unfortunately can also be used for exploitation.  Recognizing this, I 
have limited this program from editing Battle Ground maps.  These maps 
alone however are obviously not the only ones that can be edited to give a 
user an unfair advantage in the game...

I ask that you please refrain from taking advantage, keep in mind you are 
NOT the only one with this program.  And should you among many other 
start using this application to cheat Blizzard will obviously nerf map editing.  
Yes, they can do it, and they haven't done it yet because it's not higher in 
priority as taking care of other exploits, SO LETS KEEP IT THAT WAY!!!!

If you think additional maps should be black-listed please say so on the 
message forum here:
