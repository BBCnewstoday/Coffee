Old files used for creating maps, model edits and what not in World of Warcraft.

95% of these files were done by others. I do not have full credits for all of them as 90% of the sites and places that hosted them are gone. If you can prove you made one of these files, please send me a message and I will update the information to show this.

These are probably not working for the latest version of WoW, and I take no responsibility for them. I've had them for years since I was in the WoW ME Community, and I figured it's time to share them as it's been a long time since they've actually been usefull.
