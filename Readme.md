Old files used for creating maps, model edits and what not in World of Warcraft.

These are probably not working for the latest version of WoW, and I take no responsibility for them. I've had them for years since I was in the WoW ME Community, and I figured it's time to share them as it's been a long time since they've actually been usefull.
